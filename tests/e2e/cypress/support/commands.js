// This JS commands file mirrors the TypeScript commands.ts
// Add or copy any custom commands here. For now it contains no-op comments
// and example code placeholders.

// Example:
// Cypress.Commands.add('login', (email, password) => { /* ... */ })

// Keep file intentionally lightweight — extend as needed.
